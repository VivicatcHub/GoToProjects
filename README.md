## Installation

### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone or download this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VivicatcHub/GoToProjects.git
cd GoToProjects
```

2. Run the installation script (requires sudo):

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

3. The script will:
   - Verify that all necessary files exist
   - Create a `gtp` script with integrated absolute paths
   - Install it to `/usr/bin/gtp`
   - Make the binary accessible from anywhere

### Option 2: Manual Installation (local usage)

If you prefer to use the tool without system installation:

```bash
# From the GoToProjects directory
source ./gtp <project_name>
```

This method doesn't require root privileges but only works from the project directory.

## Configuration

### Create your configuration file

1. Copy the example file:

```bash
cp config_example.json config.json
```

2. Edit `config.json` according to your projects:

```json
{
  "my-project": {
    "path": "/home/user/Projects/my-project/",
    "vscode": true,
    "pull": true,
    "commands": ["npm install", "npm run dev"]
  },
  "another-project": {
    "path": "/home/user/Work/another-project/",
    "vscode": false,
    "pull": false,
    "commands": ["docker-compose up -d", "echo 'Project started!'"]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

For each project, you can define:

- **`path`** (required): Absolute path to the project directory
- **`vscode`** (optional): `true` to automatically open VS Code
- **`pull`** (optional): `true` to automatically execute `git pull`
- **`commands`** (optional): List of commands to execute in order

## Usage

### After installation (recommended)

Simply use the `gtp` command from anywhere:

```bash
gtp <project-name>
```

### Local usage (without installation)

From the GoToProjects directory:

```bash
source ./gtp <project-name>
```

### Examples

```bash
# Go to project "wow"
gtp wow

# The script will:
# 1. Navigate to /incredible/wow
# 2. Execute git pull (if pull: true)
# 3. Execute all defined commands in order
# 4. Open VS Code (if vscode: true)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Directory change doesn't persist

**Problem**: After running `gtp`, you're still in the original directory.

**Solutions**:

- ‚úÖ Use `gtp <project>` after system installation
- ‚úÖ Use `source ./gtp <project>` for local usage
- ‚ùå Never use `./gtp <project>` (runs in a subshell)

### Project not found

The script suggests similar projects based on the first letter:

```bash
$ gtp ma
‚ùì Project 'ma' not found.
üìã Available projects: marin-kitagawa
```

### Path errors

Verify that:

- The path in `config.json` is correct
- You have permissions to access the directory
- The directory exists

### Temporary script not generated

**Problem**: Message "‚ùå No script generated for project 'X'"

**Possible causes**:

- The project doesn't exist in `config.json`
- Error in the Python script
- Insufficient permissions to write to `/tmp/`

**Solution**: Verify that the project exists and that the `config.json` file is valid.

## Uninstallation

To remove `gtp` from the system:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/bin/gtp
```

## Technical Information

### Architecture

1. **`go_to_project.py`**: Main Python script that:

   - Reads the JSON configuration
   - Generates a temporary shell script with commands
   - Places the script in `/tmp/gtp_<project_name>.sh`

2. **`gtp`**: Shell wrapper script that:

   - Calls the Python script
   - Sources the generated temporary script
   - Cleans up the temporary file

3. **`install.sh`**: Installation script that:
   - Creates a version of `gtp` with absolute paths
   - Installs it to `/usr/bin/`

### Temporary Files

Temporary scripts are created in `/tmp/gtp_<project_name>.sh` and automatically deleted after use.

## Version History
